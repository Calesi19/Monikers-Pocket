# Monikers Pocket

The Monikers party game as a pass-and-play web app: one phone, two teams,
three rounds. Describe the name, then one word only, then charades — with
the same deck all the way through.

**Play it:** https://calesi19.github.io/Monikers-Pocket/

- 181 built-in name cards with a short blurb each, plus optional custom
  names added during setup
- 30/40/50-card decks, 45/60/90-second turns
- The game saves itself after every move — refresh, lock the phone, come
  back later and resume
- Installable as a PWA and fully playable offline once loaded

Built with React + TypeScript + Vite + Tailwind. The game logic lives in
`src/game/engine.ts` as a pure, serializable state machine; the deck is in
`src/game/names.ts`.
